        <p>
          This mapping project is an ongoing effort to curate and share restoration knowledge for the Garry Oak Meadow ecosystem. Building off of the Garry Oak Ecosystems Recovery Team's (GOERT) extensive work and existing list of 70+ restoration projects in Canada, the Restoration Futures Lab have tried to compile information on restoration projects in oak meadows across their Canadian range. The goal is to make projects visible, to allow everyone to explore the methods and goals of their local restoration, and to share documentation on the results of projects regionally.        </p>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Based on input from the lab, I identified two core personas that would benefit from easy access to the information about restoration projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The Retiree:</strong> this archetype describes people interested in restoration projects in their neighbourhood. They work on their own restoration projects, organize volunteers, and want to network with other people working on similar projects. They are not professional ecologists, and often look for examples of how other people have dealt with the problems they face.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "As someone without a lot of experience in ecological restoration, I want to learn which techniques I should apply to dealing with this weed."
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    "As someone without a lot of expertise with computers, it's important to me that the map provides lots of guidance and feedback so I can find the information I need."
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>The Staff:</strong> this archetype describes government employees working with natural science and ecology. They use this website as a resource for teaching the public about ecological restoration projects, and for training new employees on past or ongoing projects.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "As someone new to the ecological restoration community, seeing which organizations have worked on projects is important for building my network of professional connections."
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    "As an employee with a specific jurisdiction, seeing projects that have been undertaken in my jurisdiction will help me understand the history of my region."
                </blockquote>
            </li>

            Based on the personas and an interview with the head of the Restoration Futures Lab, there are four core flows that the website needs to support:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Users need to be able to search for project keywords</li>
            <li>Users should be able to filter results based on plant species and/or restoration techniques</li>
            <li>Users should be able to view historic and current distribution of the ecosystems, providing valuable context for restoration efforts</li>
            <li>Users should be able to view a project's details</li>
        </ol>
