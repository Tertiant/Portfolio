With numerous retailers offering a limited selection of cards at varying prices, Magic: the Gathering players often face challenges finding the cards they want at an acceptable price. The goal of Treasure Hunt is to provide a current and comprehensive overview of card prices and availability across Canadian magic stores. This would save players time, effort, and money, empowering them to enjoy the game without breaking the bank.
