<p>To gain insight into the finer points of how people buy Magic cards, I conducted in-person and phone interviews with five Canadian Magic players. The results showed that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Players generally don't browse, they decide on the cards they want and then check to see if they are affordable or available at their preferred store. If no, they are willing to either wait until it becomes available or they cast a wider net and look at other stores.</li>
    <li>Respondents generally felt that that it takes too long to find the cards they want, that information about stock levels across stores is not readily available, and that it can be difficult to know if the price of a card is fair.</li>
    <li>The general sentiment was that a price comparison website like Treasure Hunt would be useful for saving time and/or money.</li>
    <li>The top three features players want to see in Treasure Hunt are accurate cost/inventory data, an easy way to find specific cards using search terms/filters, and the ability to control which stores are included in the results.</li>
    <li>The top three dealbreakers for players are if the interface is slow or frustrating, if the data is inaccurate, or if there is an abundance of ads/scams.</li>
