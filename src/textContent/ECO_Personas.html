    Based on input from the lab, I identified two core personas that would benefit from easy access to the information about restoration projects:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Retiree:</strong> this archetype describes people interested in restoration projects in their neighbourhood. They work on their own restoration projects, organize volunteers, and want to network with other people working on similar projects. They are not professional ecologists, and often look for examples of how other people have dealt with the problems they face.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "As someone without a lot of experience in ecological restoration, I want to learn which techniques I should apply to dealing with this weed."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "As someone without a lot of expertise with computers, it's important to me that the map provides lots of guidance and feedback so I can find the information I need."
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Regulator:</strong> this archetype describes government employees working with natural science and ecology. They use this website as a resource for teaching the public about ecological restoration projects, and for training new employees on past or ongoing projects.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "As someone new to the ecological restoration community, seeing which organizations have worked on projects is important for building my network of professional connections."
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            "As an employee with a specific jurisdiction, seeing projects that have been undertaken in my jurisdiction will help me understand the history of my region."
        </blockquote>
    </li>
</ul>
