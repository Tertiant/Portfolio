In this project, I built a webmap showcasing ecological restoration projects in Garry Oak ecosystems on Vancouver Island. Leveraging the Mapbox API, I developed a visually appealing and interactive map that allowed users to filter the data and toggle between different map layers. The webmap served as a comprehensive resource for individuals interested in Garry Oak restoration efforts, providing valuable information on project locations, status, methods, and other details.
