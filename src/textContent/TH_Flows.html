    Continuing from the interviews, surveys, and personas there are five core flows that the website needs to support:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Users need to be able to search for cards</li>
    <li>Users should be able to filter results based on card attributes like condition, foiling, and art</li>
    <li>Users should be able to add cards to a watchlist</li>
    <li>Users should be able to view a card's details</li>
    <li>Users should be able to buy any number of cards directly through the website</li>
</ol>
