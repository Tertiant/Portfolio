This mapping project is an ongoing effort to curate and share restoration knowledge for the Garry Oak Meadow ecosystem. Building off of the Garry Oak Ecosystems Recovery Team's (GOERT) extensive work and existing list of 70+ restoration projects in Canada, the Restoration Futures Lab have tried to compile information on restoration projects in oak meadows across their Canadian range. The goal is to make projects visible, to allow everyone to explore the methods and goals of their local restoration, and to share documentation on the results of projects regionally.
