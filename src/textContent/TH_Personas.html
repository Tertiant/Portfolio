    Based on the interviews and surveys, I identified two core personas that would be interested in this website:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Creative:</strong> this archetype describes people who enjoy the deckbuilding side of the game, who enjoy building several different decks. They like discovering cards, they buy many cheap cards, and they need the ability to bookmark cards as they brainstorm decks.</p>
        <blockquote>
            “As someone a busy schedule, I want to be able to find the cards I'm looking for quickly so that I can spend more time building the decks or playing with friends.”
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            “As someone with a set budget for magic cards, I want to be able to find the cheapest option for the cards I want so that I can play the decks I want without breaking the bank.”
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><strong>The Collector:</strong> this archetype describes people who are always on the hunt for rare or expensive cards. Finding price differences between stores or getting notifications when an item is back in stock are critical for collecting cards the cards they want.</p>
        <blockquote>
            “As someone who collects rare cards, I want to be able to check local stock quickly and receive notifications when cards on my list are in stock so that I can catch the ones that are hard to find before someone else does.”
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            “As someone whose time is valuable, being able to copy/paste in a list of cards and buy them all in one place would save me a lot of money.”
        </blockquote>
    </li>
</ul>
